Academic and Professional Fields Used at Each Degree Level,,,,
"In an effort to provide the most useful points for comparison, the Humanities Indicators (HI) use a slightly different mix of academic and professional fields at each degree level. As shown on the next worksheet, each of the six-digit degree categories in the Department of Education's Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) is assigned to one of the fields below depending on the degree level. 

All data for the period 1987 onward are derived from the National Science Foundation's (NSF) online data system, WebCASPAR, using the IPEDS Completions Survey tables. Users wishing to replicate the HI's degree counts should select ""Degrees Conferred (NSF population of institutions)"" as their analysis variable. For helpful information on how to use WebCASPAR effectively, visit the site's ""Tutorials Page"" at https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/webcaspar/Help/tutorial.jsp?subHeader=Tutorial. ",,,,
